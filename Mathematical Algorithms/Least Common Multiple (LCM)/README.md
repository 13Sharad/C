# Least Common Multiple
## Description
The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. In other words, it is the smallest number into which both original numbers can be evenly divided without leaving a remainder.

## How to Calculate the LCM:
There are several methods to find the LCM of two numbers:
### 1. Using Prime Factorization:
Factorize each number into its prime factors.
Identify all prime numbers that appear in either factorization.
For each prime factor, select the highest power that appears in the factorizations.
Multiply these prime powers together to get the LCM.
Example:To find the LCM of 12 and 18
Prime factorization of 12: 2
