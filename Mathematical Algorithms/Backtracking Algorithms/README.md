# Backtracking Algorithms

## Description

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandons each candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot be extended to a valid solution. Backtracking is commonly used for solving combinatorial problems, constraint satisfaction problems, and puzzles.

### Problem Definition

Backtracking algorithms are used to find all (or some) solutions to a problem by exploring all potential candidates. When a candidate is found to be invalid, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries the next candidate.

### Common Applications

Some common applications of backtracking include:
- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Filling a partially filled Sudoku grid with numbers while obeying the Sudoku rules.
- **Permutations and Combinations**: Generating all possible arrangements or selections of a given set of elements.
- **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

### Algorithm Overview

The basic steps of a backtracking algorithm are:
1. **Choose**: Select an option from the available choices.
2. **Explore**: Recursively attempt to build a solution from the current state.
3. **Check**: If the current state is a valid solution, record it; if not, backtrack to the previous state and try the next option.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of backtracking algorithms varies based on the specific problem but can be exponential in the worst case, especially for combinatorial problems.
