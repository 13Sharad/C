## Duck Number

### Problem Description
A **Duck Number** is a positive number that contains at least one `0` in any position except the first. Duck Numbers do not start with the digit `0`, but they must have at least one `0` in other positions.

### Example
- **405**: Duck Number (contains `0` at the second position).
- **102**: Duck Number (contains `0` at the second position).
- **1205**: Duck Number (contains `0` at the third position).
- **321**: Not a Duck Number (no `0` present).
- **0351**: Not a Duck Number (starts with `0`).

### Additional Context
This problem is commonly asked in coding interviews to test understanding of number properties and string manipulation. Identifying Duck Numbers is also a useful exercise in handling number representations in programming languages.
