# Sudoku Solver

## Description

The Sudoku Solver is a backtracking algorithm designed to fill in a partially completed Sudoku grid. The algorithm works by trying to place digits from 1 to 9 in each empty cell and checking if the placement is valid. It uses backtracking to explore all possibilities and find a valid solution.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A `9x9` grid with some pre-filled cells.

Objective:
- Complete the grid such that each row, column, and `3x3` subgrid contains digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

### Algorithm Overview

1. Identify the empty cell.
2. Place digits from 1 to 9 in the empty cell.
3. If valid, move to the next empty cell.
4. If no valid number can be placed, backtrack.
5. Repeat the process until the entire grid is filled.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Sudoku Solver can be exponential in the worst case due to the vast number of possible grid configurations.
