# Traveling Salesman Problem: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Overview


#### **Problem** : Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a well-known NP-hard problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. Given a set of cities and the distances between them, TSP asks for the shortest possible tour.

#### **Proposed Algorithm** : Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA)** is a **greedy algorithm** for solving TSP. It constructs a solution by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited city until all cities are visited. This algorithm doesn't guarantee the optimal solution but offers a fast heuristic approach, especially useful for medium-sized problems.

# Data Structure

* **cities[]** : An array of city coordinates (2D points), represented as tuples of (x, y) coordinates.
* **visited[]** : A boolean array to track which cities have been visited.
* **tour[]** : An array that stores the sequence of cities in the final tour.
* **distance[][]** : A matrix or function to calculate distances between two cities.

### **Key Functions**

1. **int nearestNeighborTSP(cities[], int startCity)** :

* This function implements the **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm** for the TSP.
* **Input** :
  * `cities[]`: An array of city coordinates.
  * `startCity`: The index of the city from where the tour starts.
* **Output** :
  * Returns a complete tour (an ordered list of cities representing the shortest path as calculated by the algorithm).
* **Steps** :
  1. Start at `startCity`.
  1. From the current city, find the nearest unvisited city.
  1. Add the nearest city to the tour and mark it as visited.
  1. Repeat until all cities are visited.
  1. Return to the starting city.

1. **double calculateDistance(city1, city2)** :

* **Input** :
  * `city1`: Coordinates (x1, y1) of the first city.
  * `city2`: Coordinates (x2, y2) of the second city.
* **Output** :
  * Returns the Euclidean distance between two cities.

1. **void greedyTour(cities[], int startCity)** :

* A wrapper function that prints the tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and calculates the total distance of the tour.
* **Input** :
  * `cities[]`: Array of city coordinates.
  * `startCity`: The index of the city to start the tour.
* **Output** :
  * Prints the order of cities in the tour and the total distance traveled
