# AlgoGenesis: C Algorithms üìò

Welcome to the **AlgoGenesis** collection of algorithms implemented in the **C programming language**. This repository aims to provide a centralized, well-documented source of algorithms that can help both beginners and advanced developers in understanding and solving algorithmic problems efficiently.

---

## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementations of a variety of algorithms written in **C** and licensed under the **GPLv3 License**. The algorithms cover a wide range of topics from **computer science**, **mathematics**, **statistics**, **data science**, **machine learning**, and **engineering**. The implementations are designed to serve as a learning resource for both **educators** and **students**. For some algorithms, you may find multiple implementations that demonstrate different strategies or optimizations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Algorithm Library**: Includes a variety of algorithms implemented in C, one of the most fundamental and general-purpose programming languages.
- **Well-documented Source Code**: Each implementation includes detailed explanations to assist learners in understanding the underlying concepts.
- **Standard C Library Usage**: All implementations use the standard C library (libc), and no external libraries are required for compilation or execution.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: The code is regularly tested and compiled on the latest versions of MacOS and Ubuntu, using AppleClang 14.0.0 and GNU 11.3.0, ensuring reliability across different environments.
- **Adherence to C11 Standard**: The repository strictly follows the C11 standard, ensuring portability to embedded systems like ESP32, ARM Cortex, and others.
- **Self-checks for Correctness**: Many programs include self-checking mechanisms to ensure accurate implementations.
- **Modular and Open-Source**: The modular nature of the code allows easy integration into other projects, and the open-source GPLv3 licensing ensures accessibility and flexibility for all users.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated directly from the source code, providing a complete resource for each algorithm. This includes:

- Source code snippets
- Detailed explanations of how the algorithms work
- Instructions on compiling and executing the programs
- Flow diagrams illustrating program execution
- Links to relevant external resources when necessary

The documentation is available online and is continuously updated with new content as new algorithms are added.
