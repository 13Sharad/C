The Misère Nim algorithm is a strategic solution to a variant of the classic Nim game where the objective differs slightly: in Misère Nim, the player forced to take the last stone loses the game, while in regular Nim, the player who takes the last stone wins.

### Key Aspects of the Algorithm

1. **XOR Sum**:
   - In both Nim and Misère Nim, the XOR sum of all piles (`xorSum`) is a critical factor. This sum helps determine whether the current game state is favorable or not.
   - If `xorSum` is zero at any turn, the game is said to be in a "losing position" for the player about to make a move, provided the opponent plays optimally.

2. **All-Ones Condition**:
   - In Misère Nim, if all piles have exactly one stone (an "all-ones" configuration), the game's dynamics change. If every pile has one stone, the game can be decided by counting the parity (odd/even count) of the piles:
     - If `xorSum` is zero in an "all-ones" configuration, then the second player will win if both play optimally.
     - Otherwise, if there are piles with more than one stone, the standard Nim rules apply.

3. **Winning and Losing Conditions**:
   - If `xorSum != 0` and not all piles have exactly one stone, the first player has a winning strategy. This result follows the standard rule that if `xorSum` is non-zero, the player can make a move that eventually forces the opponent into a zero `xorSum` state, leading them into a losing position.
   - If all piles have one stone and `xorSum == 0`, then the second player wins, as the first player is forced into taking the last stone.

This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of piles, due to its reliance on a single traversal through the pile list. Misère Nim provides a great example of how altering a game's winning condition can significantly change the strategy, despite the underlying mechanics being nearly identical to standard Nim.
