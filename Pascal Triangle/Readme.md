# Pascal's Triangle Generator in C

## Description

This program generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row. It has wide applications in algebra, combinatorics, and probability.

## How It Works

- The first and last elements of each row are set to 1.
- Any other element is the sum of the two elements above it.
- The user inputs the number of rows, and the program prints the corresponding Pascal's Triangle.

## Example

For `n = 5`, the output will be:
1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1
