Here is an example of a `README.md` file for your C program that toggles a bit at a given position in a number.

# Toggling Bits in C

This program toggles a bit at a specified position in a given number. It takes a number `n` and a position `pos`, then toggles the bit at the position `pos` of the number `n`. 

## How It Works

- A bitwise shift operation is used to create a mask that has a `1` at the desired bit position.
- The XOR (^) operator is then applied to toggle the bit at that position.

For example:
- If `n = 5` (binary: `101`) and the position is `1`, toggling the bit at position 1 would result in `7` (binary: `111`).
  
## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

1. **Compile** the program using a C compiler like `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc -o toggle toggle_bits.c
   ```

2. **Run** the program:

   ```bash
   ./toggle
   ```

## Input and Output

### Input:
1. The program first asks for an integer input (`n`), which is the number whose bit you want to toggle.
2. Then, it asks for a position (`pos`) to specify which bit to toggle.

### Output:
- The program outputs the result after toggling the bit at the specified position.

### Example:

#### Input:
```
Enter a number: 5
Enter a position to toggle: 1
```

#### Output:
```
After toggling the bit at position 1, the result is: 7
```
